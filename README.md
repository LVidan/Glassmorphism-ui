# Glassmorphism-ui

User Interfaces (UI) are a crucial element in the success and acceptability of apps and websites. And since user interfaces are about looks and design languages, it is susceptible to change in prevailing trends & fashion. Over the years, various evolving styles have influenced the UI ecosystem. Skeuomorphism eventually gave way to flat, minimalistic designs. Then came Neumorphism, which was inspired by objects in the physical world. The latest trend that has taken the UI world by storm is Glassmorphism. 

Glassmorphism is the latest trend in user interfaces and is rapidly growing in popularity. One of the more mainstream applications of this design appeared in Apple’s macOS Big Sur which rolled out in 2020. But what is Glassmorphism? As the name indicates, it has a transparent, glassy look. It is possible for users to see through layers. These layers can help to introduce hierarchy in the structure. The features of this new UI style – as enumerated by Michal Malewicz in his blog are as follows:

Transparency- As explained above, this design resembles a virtual glass, with background blur. 
A multi-layered approach which looks like the objects are floating in space. 
The blurred effect is accentuated with vibrant colours. 
A subtle border on the translucent objects.
